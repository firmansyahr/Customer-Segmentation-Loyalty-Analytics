This project focuses on building a data-driven customer segmentation model to support loyalty program optimization.

Using transaction data from building material retailers, multiple clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN) are evaluated to identify distinct customer behavior patterns. The analysis highlights misalignment between existing loyalty tiers and actual customer value, enabling more effective tier restructuring and targeted retention strategies.

The repository demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering evaluation, and business insight generation.
